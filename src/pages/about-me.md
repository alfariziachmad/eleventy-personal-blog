I am a graduate of CCIT-FTUI with a GPA of 3.41 as a Diploma in Information Technology. I am highly motivated, responsible for my work, and adapt quickly to a dynamic work environment. 
I love playing musical instruments (guitar), heavy metal music, and playing single-player campaign or story-driven games.
Currently working at PT Teknologika Integrator Indonesia | [Jakartawebhosting.com](https://www.jakartawebhosting.com/) as Technical Support.
